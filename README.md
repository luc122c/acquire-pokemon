## Stack

The major components are listed below:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- [oFetch](https://unjs.io/packages/ofetch) - Typed fetch with built-in JSON decoding
- [unstorage](https://unjs.io/packages/unstorage) - Typed access to local storage API
- [Promise Pool](https://superchargejs.com/docs/3.x/promise-pool) - Used to limit concurrent requests to the API.
- [pokenode-ts](https://github.com/Gabb-c/pokenode-ts) - TypeScript wrapper for the API. I am only using this for TypeScript interfaces.

## Design

- CSS reset
